# Song Search App

## Preface

The goal behind developing this app was to further build and master the use of Javascript. To do so, I decided to make a simple API fetch call to receive JSON data and displayinf that data into the UI of the webpage. 

Developing this application helps me to be familiar with how to make a GET request, understanding local and global variables and their capablities. Understanding the purpose of breakpoints in debugging. Understanding the concept of block statements. Nesting functions and as well as understanding the use of different Javascript functions in reading HTML values

### Function

- Takes input from user and displays corresponding API data unto UI.
